Implementation for fetching the data for the short-description of different topics from a json-file seems to be slow down the loading of the site. Therefore I decided to write it down in the html-file and show only the part which is chosen at the given moment (hide the rest).
The try with the json-file was in order to keep the html-file lean. But I change the strategy for the given reason.
