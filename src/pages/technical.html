            <article> ---  learn-history ----
                ---getting curious-july 2021
                read article about people who changed to a coding job 
                with the help of coding-bootcamps in the pandemic - opportunity 
                because they  wanted to change sth. anyway
                already got in contact with coding during studies in university
                which i liked so i decided to give it a try
                ---testing phase - august 2021 
                start with java videos on youtube for 3 weeks
                bought a udemy-course and practiced coding through challenges and by coding 
                along the course
                --getting serious - october 2021
                realized that i am enjoying it and that i want to and could do it as profession
                --change to web-development - end of october
                after talking to a friend who works as a coder and advised me to focus on this field 
                because of the industry is moving more and more to the web, I decided to move my focus. 
                I bought a web-development course on udemy 
                -- diversify my sources of learning - november 2021
                started with the free courses of free code-camp in order to get different
                ways of material explanation and exercises  
                
    
                - milestone -  finish "The Web Development Bootcamp 2022" by Colt Steele --- 16.01.2022
                - milestone -  freeCodeCamp "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification" --- 31.01.2022
    
                -- start react - february 2022
                started my next udemy course on react
                
                realized that coding along and that I could follow the explanations was not enough. 
                My css skills were not good enough to use it on tasks that I did not see before. 
                For Java Script exercises I knew how to get to the solutions by searching for answers
                I did not know by remembering in the internet. For css I evn did not know how to google 
                for solutions.
                So I decided to go one step back first...
    
                -- deepen knowledge one html and css - end of february
                discover The Odin Project which I liked very much because the workflow of a real project
                with git and github work with the command line etc. 
                was embedded from the beginning of the course.
                I concentrated on the Odin Project until I felt that my css skills were good enough to proceed
